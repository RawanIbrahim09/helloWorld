My introduction for Machine Learning lab

My name is Rawan Ibrahim.

I am a student majoring in AI, with an interest in data analysis and problem solving.

I am particularly interested in Machine Learning because it allows computers to learn from data and make intelligent decisions. I am excited to learn how machine learning techniques can be applied to real-world problems.
